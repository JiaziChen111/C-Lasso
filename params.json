  "body": "# C-Lasso Replication Package\r\n\r\n#### Liangjun Su, Zhentao Shi and Peter Phillips\r\n\r\nWe provide all code for the empirical applications and simulations in [“Identifying Latent Structures in Panel Data”](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2448189). Please contact Zhentao Shi ([zhentao.shi@cuhk.edu.hk](zhentao.shi@cuhk.edu.hk)) if you have any question about the code.\r\n\r\nThe results in the paper are generated under\r\n* Matlab 8.5\r\n* CVX 2.1 (http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/)  \r\n* Mosek 7.1 (https://www.mosek.com/resources/downloads).\r\n\r\nCVX must be installed and linked with Matlab, and Mosek is invoked as the solver through the command `cvx_solver mosek`. Without Mosek, a user can still run the code with CVX if he comments out this line; however, the default solvers in CVX, such as `SDPT3` or `SeDuMi`.\r\n\r\nThe empirical applications can be exactly replicated by the commented `master.m` in folders\r\n* `app_saving_PLS`: for Section 5.1\r\n* `app_saving_PGMM`: for Section 5.1\r\n* `app_civil_war`: for Section 5.2\r\n* `app_democracy`: for Section S4.3\r\n\r\nData are also provided in each folder.\r\n\r\nThe workhorse scripts that execute the iterative algorithm in Section 3.1 of the Supplementary Material are\r\n* `PLS_est.m`: for PLS estimation\r\n* `PGMM_est.m`: for PGMM estimation\r\n* `PNL_est.m`: for the PPL (Panel Probit) estimation\r\n\r\nThe scripts in folders `simulations` generate the simulation results. The master files are either `master_**` or `**_super`. Super parameters, such as `N`, `T` and `Rep`, should be provided outside of the main function or script.\r\n",
